# Rolls the hosted control plane's Railway services onto one release.
#
# The five services are pinned to explicit image tags rather than a moving
# `:prod`, so a release does not deploy itself and a rollback is naming the
# previous tag. This script is what moves the pins, in one order, with a gate
# between each step.
#
# Order is not cosmetic: the backend applies the embedded migrations on boot,
# so it goes first and nothing else moves until it answers. A consumer that
# boots against a schema its build has never seen is the failure this prevents.
#
# The Kafka suffix is decided by what the release publishes, not by preference:
# backend, consumer and tracking have `-kafka` variants linking librdkafka,
# realtime and forms do not. Sending a node or a service a tag that was never
# built is a boot loop, so the map lives here once.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/deploy-railway.sh v0.4.13            # roll every service
#   scripts/deploy-railway.sh v0.4.12 --dry-run  # print the plan, touch nothing
#   scripts/deploy-railway.sh v0.4.13 --only realtime,forms
#
# Needs: railway CLI (>= 5.49), jq, curl, and either a linked project or
# RAILWAY_TOKEN scoped to the target environment.
