# Checks that every published image can be pulled by a stranger.
#
# GHCR creates a package private and does NOT inherit the repository's
# visibility, so an image published from a public repo by a green workflow is
# still unreadable to everyone outside the org until an owner flips it by hand
# in the UI. There is no API for that flip, which means nothing in CI can fix
# it and everything in CI must at least notice it: releases v0.1.0 through
# v0.4.0 all shipped a `curl | sh` installer that could not pull a single byte,
# and every check we had passed, because each one ran authenticated (#371).
#
# So this speaks to the registry the way an anonymous `docker pull` does: an
# unauthenticated token, then the manifest. No docker, no login, no
# credentials to accidentally inherit from the runner.
#
# It prints "<service><TAB><digest>" per image on stdout, so the release can
# build images.json out of the same public view it just verified rather than
# out of a privileged one.
