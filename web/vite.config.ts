// It is never a required build step: a fork, a self-host build or a local
// `pnpm build` sets none of these and the plugin is simply not in the plugin
// list, so nothing needs a Sentry account and nothing is uploaded. CI passes
// the token as a build secret only for the hosted release.
//
// Source maps are emitted only in that case too, so the shipped bundle is
// unchanged for everybody else, and `filesToDeleteAfterUpload` keeps the .map
// files out of the image once they have been sent.
