// Source maps, and nothing else, is what this section decides.

// Uploading them is never a required build step: a fork, a self-host build or a
// local `pnpm build` configures neither backend, so nothing needs an account
// anywhere and nothing is uploaded. CI passes the credentials as build secrets
// only for the hosted release.
//
// Source maps are emitted only when something is going to upload them, so the
// shipped bundle is unchanged for everybody else. PostHog's are uploaded after
// the build by the `sourcemaps:posthog` script, which is also what deletes the
// .map files afterwards, so the Sentry plugin only deletes them when it is the
// one upload configured.
