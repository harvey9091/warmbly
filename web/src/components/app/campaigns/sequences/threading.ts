 * conversationOpenerFor is the step that opened the conversation a step at

 * the question on; the first that does not is the one that opened the thread.
 *
 * `null` means there is no earlier email step, so this one opens the
 * conversation whatever its switch says.
 *
 * It mirrors the walk the send path does over the contact's actual sends, so
 * the composer shows what the recipient will read. It follows the canvas order
 * rather than branch targets: a step several branches reach can be opened by a
 * different email on each path, and the editor has to show one answer. The
 * send path resolves it per contact from what they were actually sent, so this
 * is a preview, and for a linear sequence the two always agree.
