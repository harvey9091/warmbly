// Remembers where a scroll container was left, per list identity, and puts it
// back.
//
// Two things throw a scroll offset away and neither is under the component's
// control: unmounting (leaving the page and coming back) and `display: none`
// (the responsive panes below `md`, where the browser silently zeroes
// scrollTop). Both land the user back at the top of a list they had scrolled
// through, which is issue #396.
//
// Offsets live in a module-level map, so they survive a remount for as long as
// the tab does, and are keyed by whatever identifies the list's contents (scope
// + filters). A different key is a different list: it starts at the top.
//
// The restore is deliberately timid. It stops the moment the user touches the
// wheel, a finger or a key, and it gives up after a short window. A container
// that merely came back from `display: none` is only touched while it sits at
// the top, which is the one offset that has to be the browser's doing rather
// than the user's: a top the user scrolled to was recorded as a top. It keeps
// retrying while the list is still filling in, so a return to a list whose rows
// arrive a frame or two later still lands where it should.
