// Single source of truth for "log this user out fully". Order matters:
//
//   1. Server revoke first, so the session row is gone before we throw
//      away the access token we'd need to authenticate the revoke call.
//      Wrapped so a network error here still falls through to local
//      cleanup — a stranded server session is recoverable, a stuck
//      client is not.
//   2. clearTokens() wipes every localStorage key the auth layer uses
//      (legacy four-key set + the canonical `auth_token`). UserNav used
//      to remove a non-existent key called "token" and leak everything.
//   3. queryClient.clear() drops every cached query. Without this, the
//      next login would still see the prior user's `/auth/me`, contacts,
//      orgs, etc. because `useUser` has `refetchOnMount: false`.
//   4. persist.clearStorage() + a manual slice reset removes the
//      persisted `currentOrganization` so the next user doesn't inherit
//      it from `warmbly-storage` in localStorage.
