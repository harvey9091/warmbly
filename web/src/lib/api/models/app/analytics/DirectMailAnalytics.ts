// GET /analytics/direct — hand-written mail, as opposed to campaign sends.
//
// Two sources on purpose, because they answer different questions over
// different sets of messages:
//
//   volume   — from the synced mailbox, so it covers everything the mailbox
//              sent (including mail written in Gmail or on a phone) and it
//              covers history from before tracking existed.
//   tracking — from the send records, so it covers only mail sent through
//              Warmbly by a mailbox with tracking switched on, and only since
//              it was switched on.
//
// The UI keeps them in separate cards for that reason. Blending them into one
// "open rate" would divide opens we can see by sends we never measured.
