// RequireFreshAuth refuses a request whose session has not re-proved the
// account holder recently.
//
// CASA 2.4.1 asks for a full session plus re-authentication or a secondary
// check before a sensitive account change. Changing a password and disabling
// 2FA already demand a current credential; the actions gated here are the rest
// of that set. Each either hands out a credential that outlives the session
// that created it (an API key, a passkey registered to a device) or cannot be
// reversed by the person it was done to (ownership transfer, scheduled
// deletion), which is more than a live token alone should carry.
//
// The caller re-authenticates at POST /v1/auth/reauth and retries.
//
// This applies to session callers only. An API key and an OAuth token have no
// session and no way to present a second factor, and they are not the threat
// this addresses: the risk is a browser token lifted from a machine somebody
// walked away from. A key is already a deliberate, scoped, revocable grant that
// was itself minted from a confirmed session, its use is audited, and the
// permission gate on the route decides what it may do. Refusing them here would
// break every automation, the CLI included, to exceed what the control asks
// for.
