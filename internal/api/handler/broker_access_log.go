// Access logging for the two internal endpoints that hand out something worth
// more than a record: the data-key decrypt broker and the blob presigner.
//
// CASA 6.7.1 asks that access to server-side secrets be logged or monitored,
// and these were the two that were silent. They are also the two where a
// refusal is the clearest probe signal the instance produces: a node asks for
// keys it owns and prefixes it uses, so a rejected key or a decrypt that fails
// is either a misconfigured node or somebody holding the internal token and
// looking around. Either way an operator should be able to see it.
//
// Deliberately not logged: the ciphertext, the plaintext key, and the signed
// URL. What is recorded is who asked, for what shape of thing, and whether it
// was allowed, which is what makes a pattern visible without the log itself
// becoming the leak.
