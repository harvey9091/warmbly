// actions, and inbound webhook handling for Calendly + Cal.com.
//
// Per-provider files (oauth.go, slack.go, hubspot.go, discord.go,
// google_sheets.go, calendly.go) each handle the provider-specific request /
// response shapes. The shared service.go ties them to the connections repo so
// the dashboard reads them uniformly.
